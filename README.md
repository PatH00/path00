## Hi everybody 👋 I'm Patrizia, nice to meet you 😊

📚 **Information Science Student** | 🎯 **Focus Areas: Data Management & Archiving**
## 🧐 About Me  
I am currently studying **Information Science** at the University of Applied Sciences of the Grisons, specializing in **Data Management and Archiving**.
My main interests lie in structuring, processing, and visualizing data effectively.  

📊Last year, I worked on a **dashboard project** that visualized flight data using charts. This was my first experience building a dashboard
with interactive features. It was a great opportunity to explore the best and simplest ways to present data. At the same time,
I realized that I still lack experience in coding—but instead of discouraging me, it only motivated me to push harder to reach my goals! 💪 

## 🔧 Skills & Technologies
📌 **Archiving & Metadata Standards:** ISAD(G), docuteam packer, Wayback Machine, WGET, Webrecorder, JHOVE, EXIFTOOL 
📌 **Data Visualization:** Plotly, (Seaborn) 
📌 **Programming & Scripting:** Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS  
📌 **Version Control & Collaboration:** GitHub, One Drive

## 🚀 Projects
An **Augmented Reality project**🥽
for cultural mediation at the Centro Giacometti in Stampa. The goal was to provide visitors with
an immersive experience by combining digital content with the physical exhibition. To develop the prototype, the following tools were used:
    Sims 🎮: Used to create a virtual representation of the exhibition space, designing an artist’s studio for a realistic environment.
    Vidnoz AI 🤖: Applied to generate AI-powered videos for interactive paintings, enabling digital storytelling.
    Figma 🎨: Utilized for designing the high-fidelity prototype, integrating UI elements and videos into the AR application.
This combination of tools helped create a seamless and engaging interactive exhibition experience. 🚀

A **digital archiving project** 🗃️
for preserving the bookwormsontour.ch website. The goal was to secure its structure and content
for long-term access, ensuring it remains available despite being inactive.
To achieve this, the following 💻Programs, Tools & Technologies were used:
    🌐Website Archiving & Data Capture
        WGET – Used for mirroring and downloading the website structure
        Webrecorder – Captured interactive and dynamic website content
        Wayback Machine – Archived snapshots for public access
    📂File Formats & Conversion
        Adobe Acrobat – Converted PDFs into the archive-friendly PDF/A-2b format
        EXIFTOOL – Verified metadata for image files
        JHOVE – Validated file formats for long-term preservation
        Convertio – Converted non-standard MP4 files into the correct format
        Audacity – Processed and converted audio files into WAVE format
    🗄️Data Storage & Structure
        docuteam-packer – Organized and structured the archived data
        TXT, TIFF, PDF/A-2b – Standardized text and image formats for archival purposes
        WACZ (Web Archive Collection Zipped) – Used for bundling archived web content
This set of tools ensured a structured and reliable digital preservation of bookwormsontour.ch, maintaining accessibility and data integrity.

A **research project**📚
exploring whether **AI can replace human authors** in the fantasy genre. The study examined AI-generated texts,
their distinguishability from human-written stories, and reader perceptions of AI-authored literature. A survey was conducted to analyze how
well participants could differentiate between AI and human writing.
    🤖🧠AI-Powered Writing Tools
        ChatGPT 4o – Used for text generation and analysis
        Squibler – AI-assisted tool for structuring and developing stories
        AI Dungeon – Interactive AI tool for dynamic storytelling
    🔍Survey & Data Analysis
        Lime Survey – Created and managed the survey on AI vs. human text recognition
        Excel – Processed and analyzed survey results
    💬Language Optimization
        DeepL Write – Improved text flow, precision, and grammar
This combination of tools enabled a structured and in-depth examination of AI’s potential in fantasy literature and its impact on the perception of authorship.📖
